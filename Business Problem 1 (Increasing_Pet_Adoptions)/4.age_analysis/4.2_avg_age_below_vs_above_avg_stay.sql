   Analysis Decision: Skipping Average Age Analysis for Below/Above Average Stay Periods
   
   Rationale: 
   After consideration, calculating and comparing the average age of pets for below and above average stay periods was determined to have limited practical value. 
   
   Key Factors:
   - **Reference Date Variation**: For adopted pets, age would logically be calculated at the adoption date, while for non-adopted pets, it would be calculated as of December 31, 2023. This difference in reference dates would lead to an inconsistent basis for comparison.
   - **Relevance to Adoption Analysis**: Age comparison by stay period is less meaningful for understanding adoption trends, as age at adoption already provides a more relevant metric for this purpose.
   
   Conclusion:
   Given the lack of realistic or actionable insights, we chose to omit this analysis from the project.
